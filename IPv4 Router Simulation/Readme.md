#Ipv4 Router Simulation

This project simulates some basic functions of an IPv4 router. 
## Description
Please check and read the IPv4 Router Simulcation.pdf
## Structures
* Node.h and Node.cc: The implementation a binary-tree-strutured routing table.

* part1.cc: Read routes, ARP, and PDUs files and generat the routing results by searching in the routing table.

* part2.cc: Basing on the result generated by part1, further read NAT file and translate the source IP addresses and port number. By passing data to nat_test.rb file and receiving the response, the program generates the NAT test results.
